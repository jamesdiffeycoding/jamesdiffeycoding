Hi, I’m James 👋

I'm a JavaScript addict (just try to stop me!) with a passion for mental health and the wellbeing of those poorly served by society.

I love all things visual 👀 and I'm currently honing my React and Next JS skills. 

I value quick user feedback, Agile-work practices, and selfless leadership. 🌱

As a young developer, I am keen to build the best habits from the start. If you'd be up for a chat to share your experience, please drop me a line on email @jamesdiffey8@gmail.com 📫

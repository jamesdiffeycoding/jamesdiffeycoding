**Hi, I‚Äôm James üëã**

A bit about me: 
- I'm a bit of a code addict - and JavaScript is my current drug of choice!
- I have a passion for mental health and the wellbeing of those poorly served by society.
- I love all things visual üëÄ and I'm currently honing my React and Next JS skills. 
- I value quick user feedback, Agile-work practices, and selfless leadership. üå±

As a young developer, I am keen to build the best habits from the start. If you'd be up for a chat to share your experience, please drop me a line on email @jamesdiffey8@gmail.com üì´

# Project examples

### (1) A functionality-first app for homeless shelter staff.
The application helps staff quickly record information about their service users while out in the streets or back in the shelter. Produced as my team's final project in School of Code's 2023 Winter Bootcamp.

Technologies: Next JS, React, Javascript, pure CSS, Render (deployment), Supabase (Authentication/Authorisation), Toast (popups).

### (2) A React Application for recording learnings as a developer, following React best-practices.
The application allows adding, viewing, deleting and updating (via favouriting) of learnings I record on my journey to become a great developer. It was fun to create the favourites filter option, and to experiment with a colour theme toggle in the settings. It was a great opportunity to practice setting up my code in a clear, modular way in React, as well as to practice working with local storage.

Technologies: React, Javascript, pure CSS, Vercel (deployment).

### (X) Timed code challenge examples ‚è∞ 
30 minute challenge: build a React widget using at least one hook. This ended up cute!

60 minute challenge: display a grid of colours, including their hexcodes in html. This wasn't pretty!

90 minute challenge: make a front-end Noughts and Cross app. The game logic for this was tough!

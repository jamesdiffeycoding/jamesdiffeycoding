Hi there! 

## About me 
- I'm a London-based software engineer transitioning from climate & mental health research. 
- I'm empathetic and care about the value and quality of my work.
- I was inspired to work as a software engineer after seeing the value that well-designed software can bring organisations.
- My projects thus far primarily involve JavaScript, APIs, React, Next JS and Node JS. I am also getting more comfortable with TypeScript, Python and other tools in my free time.

## Get in touch
- I'd be delighted for you to get in touch if you are looking for conscientious software engineers in your team diffeyj@outlook.com

## Learning üñ•Ô∏è
- I build projects and complete courses to help me learn.

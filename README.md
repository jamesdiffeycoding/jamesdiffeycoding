Hi there! 

## About me 
- I'm a London-based software engineer transitioning from climate & mental health research. 
- I'm empathetic and care about the value of my work.
- I was inspired to work as a software engineer after seeing the value that well-designed software can bring organisations.
- My projects thus far primarily involve JavaScript, APIs, React, Next JS and Node JS. I am also getting more comfortable with TypeScript, Python and other tools in my free time.

## Get in touch
- I'd be delighted for you to get in touch if you are looking for conscientious software engineers in your team diffeyj@outlook.com

## Learning üñ•Ô∏è
- I build projects and complete courses to help me learn.

### [Awesun: Solar Energy Visualiser (React/NextJS)](https://awesun-solar-visualiser.vercel.app/)
This application visualises the solar energy currently being produced in the UK, connecting to a dataset from University of Sheffield. The project was inspired by Winderful, which does the same for wind energy in the UK. Because of CORS fetch errors, server-side rendering in Next JS was used.

### [Mathemagical (TypeScript/React/NextJS/Jest/Playwright)](https://mathemagical.vercel.app/)
A collection of Mathematical projects, including a fully-tested, keyboard-friendly calculator app which overcomes JavaSCript's typical Mathematical rounding errors using Decimal JS - and 'Spiraliser' for animating beautiful equations using React and HTML's canvas element.

### Timed code challenges ‚è∞ 
Sometimes I like to set myself smaller challenges to test my learning.
- 30 minute challenge: build a React widget using at least one hook.
- 60 minute challenge: display a grid of colours, including their hexcodes in html.
- 120 minute challenge: make a front-end Noughts and Cross app from scratch.

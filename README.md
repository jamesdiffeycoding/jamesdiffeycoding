# Hi I'm [James!](mailto:jamesdiffey8@gmail.com)
I'm a former Master's Graduate from LSE, climate change researcher at Imperial College London and psychotherapist transitioning to the tech industry. 
My diverse background has given me a wide array of transferrable skills, including in qualitative and quantitative analysis, communication, and team wellbeing support. 

I saw the value software skills could bring organisations and enrolled on a Full Stack Development bootcamp. Since then, I've been building this portfolio of projects in a wide range of languages and frameworks. I'd be delighted to find a full time role where I can continue to grow as a developer.

So far, I have built projects using various languages and frameworks:
- Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby
- Frameworks: React, Next JS, Express APIs, Django, Flask, GraphQL, Rails, SQL

# Recent Projects üñ•Ô∏è
### [Awesun: Solar Energy Visualiser (Next)](https://awesun-solar-visualiser.vercel.app/)

This application visualises the solar energy currently being produced in the UK, connecting to a dataset from University of Sheffield. The project was inspired by Winderful, which does the same for wind energy in the UK. Because of CORS fetch errors, server-side rendering in Next JS was used.

### [Secure homeless shelter user database (Next, JS, SupaBase, Jest)](https://secure-nextjs-homeless-shelter-database.vercel.app/dashboard)

The application helps staff quickly record information about their service users while out in the streets or back in the shelter. It aims to help improve both service staff and service user experiences. This has project has already involved...
- user interviews, surveys, feedback cycles, wireframes, stakeholder meetings, project demos
- authorisation and authentication with SupaBase, auth-guarding, dynamic routing, caching prevention, React Hooks, prop-drilling, context... and more!

### [Mathemagical (TypeScript, React)](https://mathemagical.vercel.app/)
Animating beautiful equations using React, TypeScript, and canvas.

### [CRUD Pokedex App (Ruby on Rails)](https://rubyonrails-pokedex.onrender.com/pokemonsters)
A simple CRUD-functionality Pokedex App, which was my first project in Ruby on Rails, having worked primarily in React/Next JS thus far.

[![RubyDexShotBannerShort](https://github.com/jamesdiffeycoding/jamesdiffeycoding/assets/139918141/87d429f5-eaca-46e4-a655-b28c06d4a2b1)](https://rubyonrails-pokedex.onrender.com/pokemonsters)



### [Live Deployment Dashboard (Python, Flask)](https://jamesdiffeycoding-pythonlivedashboard.vercel.app/)

This application allows me to check all of my deployments statuses (and prevent any from spinning down with activity) by visiting a single site. Python, Flask and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape my sites for their html content, and the site itself displays whether the url request was valid, and whether the html response to the request was as expected.

### [A Python and Django Learning App](https://django-learning-project.vercel.app/)
A simple App, which was my first project in Python and Django, having worked primarily in React/Next JS thus far.

[![DjangoShotBanner](https://github.com/jamesdiffeycoding/jamesdiffeycoding/assets/139918141/f92fd5e0-21ea-43be-8b55-ee703a9f08bc)](https://django-learning-project.vercel.app)



### [Developer Lessons Log (React, local storage)](https://developer-lessons-react.vercel.app/)
The application allows adding, viewing, deleting and updating (via favouriting) of learnings I record on my journey to become a great developer. It was fun to create the favourites filter option, and to experiment with a colour theme toggle in the settings. It was a great opportunity to practice setting up my code in a clear, modular way in React, as well as to practice working with local storage.

### [Studio Ghibli Spotlight (HTML, CSS)](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/Animated-Wallpaper-StudioGhibli/)
A simple for-practice video and audio site with a responsive header. Autoplay prevents videos playing with audio by default, so I had to feature an audio player on the site itself.

[![GhibliShotBanner](https://github.com/jamesdiffeycoding/jamesdiffeycoding/assets/139918141/8e15b17c-d630-41f1-aeb0-815fad921f90)](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/Animated-Wallpaper-StudioGhibli)



### [A simple grid experiment (HTML, Tailwind CSS))](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/Tailwind-Responsive-Grid-Experiments/)

A simple for-practice responsive grid layout, something I had not had time to practice on other projects thus far.

[![GridResponseBanner](https://github.com/jamesdiffeycoding/jamesdiffeycoding/assets/139918141/6a50cfc3-1266-47db-8e70-dbd8e3fcf61b)](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/Tailwind-Responsive-Grid-Experiments)

### [Banana and Ivy Maze Game (JavaScript Event Listeners](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/JS-Banana-and-Ivy-Game)

I grid-based game made only out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript event listeners.

[![BananaGameShot1](https://github.com/jamesdiffeycoding/jamesdiffeycoding/assets/139918141/0cc2e1e7-1a57-49ae-878b-23d0d7cb2acc)](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/JS-Banana-and-Ivy-Game)

### Timed code challenges ‚è∞ 
Sometimes I like to set myself smaller challenges to test my learning.
- 30 minute challenge: build a React widget using at least one hook. This ended up cute!
- 60 minute challenge: display a grid of colours, including their hexcodes in html. This did not end up so cute...
- 120 minute challenge: make a front-end Noughts and Cross app. The game logic for this was the toughest part by far!

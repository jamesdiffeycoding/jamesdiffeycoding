**Hi, I’m James 👋**

A bit about me: 
- I'm a bit of a code addict - and JavaScript is my current drug of choice!
- I have a passion for mental health and the wellbeing of those poorly served by society.
- I love all things visual 👀 and I'm currently honing my React and Next JS skills. 
- I value quick user feedback, Agile-work practices, and selfless leadership. 🌱

As a young developer, I am keen to build the best habits from the start. If you'd be up for a chat to share your experience, please drop me a line on email @jamesdiffey8@gmail.com or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdiffey/)📫 


# Project examples

### (1) [A functionality-first app for homeless shelter staff.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjYaiY8oWOU&ab_channel=JamesDiffey)
The application helps staff quickly record information about their service users while out in the streets or back in the shelter. Produced as my team's final project in School of Code's 2023 Winter Bootcamp. It was useful to practice authentication methods and route-guarding, interdepedent server-hosted data tables, dynamic routing, pop-ups, and easily-navigable file structures.

Technologies: Next JS, React, Javascript, pure CSS, Render (deployment), Supabase (Authentication/Authorisation), Toast (popups).

### (2) [A React Application for recording learnings as a developer, following React best-practices](https://developer-lessons-react.vercel.app/)
The application allows adding, viewing, deleting and updating (via favouriting) of learnings I record on my journey to become a great developer. It was fun to create the favourites filter option, and to experiment with a colour theme toggle in the settings. It was a great opportunity to practice setting up my code in a clear, modular way in React, as well as to practice working with local storage.

Technologies: React, Javascript, pure CSS, Vercel (deployment).

**Hi, I‚Äôm James üëã**

I love coding in JavaScript and also broaden my knowledge by trying other languages and frameworks (e.g. Ruby on Rails). In the workplace, I value quick and regular user feedback, considerate communication, and Agile work practices.
 
Aside from that, I have a particular passion for the wellbeing of those poorly served by society.

I am keen to become the best developer and teamplayer I can be. If you'd be up for a chat to share your experience, please drop me a line on email @jamesdiffey8@gmail.com or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdiffey/)üì´ 

Below you will find an overview of some of my recent projects. I'm currently looking for work in early 2024. 



# Project examples

### [TRY IT YOURSELF: A Next JS multi-feature, secure homeless shelter user database (Vercel)](https://secure-nextjs-homeless-shelter-database.vercel.app/dashboard)

The application helps staff quickly record information about their service users while out in the streets or back in the shelter. It aims to help improve both service staff and service user experiences. This has project has already involved...
- user interviews, surveys, feedback cycles, wireframes, stakeholder meetings,project demos (this project was initially conceived and worked amongst other passionate coders)....
- authorisation and authentication with SupaBase, auth-guarding, dynamic routing, caching prevention, React Hooks, prop-drilling, context... and more!

### [A relaxing site featuring an animated Studio Ghibli video (GH Pages)](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/Animated-Wallpaper-StudioGhibli/)
A simple for-practice video and audio site. Autoplay prevents videos playing with audio by default, so I had to feature an audio player on the site itself.

Technologies: plain HTML and CSS

### [A simple Ruby On Rails Pokedex App (Render)](https://rubyonrails-pokedex.onrender.com/pokemonsters)
A simple CRUD-functionality Pokedex App, which was my first project in Ruby on Rails, having worked primarily in React/Next JS thus far! 

Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Render (deployment)

### [A colourful responsive Tailwind grid (GH Pages)](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/Tailwind-Responsive-Grid-Experiments/)

A simple for-practice responsive grid layout, something I had not had time to practice on other projects thus far.

Technologies: Tailwind CSS, Node, GitHub Pages (deployment).

### [A React Application for recording learnings as a developer, following React best-practices (Vercel)](https://developer-lessons-react.vercel.app/)
The application allows adding, viewing, deleting and updating (via favouriting) of learnings I record on my journey to become a great developer. It was fun to create the favourites filter option, and to experiment with a colour theme toggle in the settings. It was a great opportunity to practice setting up my code in a clear, modular way in React, as well as to practice working with local storage.

Technologies: React, Javascript, pure CSS, Vercel (deployment).

### Timed code challenges ‚è∞ 
Sometimes I like to set myself smaller challenges to test my learning.
- 30 minute challenge: build a React widget using at least one hook. This ended up cute!
- 60 minute challenge: display a grid of colours, including their hexcodes in html. This did not end up so cute...
- 90 minute challenge: make a front-end Noughts and Cross app. The game logic for this was the toughest part by far! 
- 120 minute challenge: make a front-end maze game. I called mine ![Banana and Ivy](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/JS-Banana-and-Ivy-Game/)

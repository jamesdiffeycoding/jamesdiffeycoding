**Hi, I‚Äôm James üëã**

A bit about me: 
- I have loved coding in JavaScript, and am trying other languages and frameworks too to broaden my knowledge(e.g. Ruby on Rails)
- I have a passion for mental health and the wellbeing of those poorly served by society.
- I love all things visual üëÄ and I'm currently honing my React and Next JS skills. 
- I value quick user feedback, Agile-work practices, and selfless leadership. üå±

As a young developer, I am keen to build the best habits from the start. If you'd be up for a chat to share your experience, please drop me a line on email @jamesdiffey8@gmail.com or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdiffey/)üì´ 


# Project examples

### [A functionality-first app for homeless shelter staff (Render)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjYaiY8oWOU&ab_channel=JamesDiffey)
The application helps staff quickly record information about their service users while out in the streets or back in the shelter. Produced as my team's final project in School of Code's 2023 Winter Bootcamp. It was useful to practice authentication methods and route-guarding, interdepedent server-hosted data tables, dynamic routing, pop-ups, and easily-navigable file structures.

Technologies: Next JS, React, Javascript, pure CSS, Render (deployment), Supabase (Authentication/Authorisation), Toast (popups).

### [A relaxing site featuring an animated Studio Ghibli video (GH Pages)](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/Animated-Wallpaper-StudioGhibli/)
A simple for-practice video and audio site. Autoplay prevents videos playing with audio by default, so I had to feature an audio player on the site itself.

Technologies: plain HTML and CSS

### [A colourful responsive Tailwind grid (GH Pages)](https://jamesdiffeycoding.github.io/Tailwind-Responsive-Grid-Experiments/)

A simple for-practice responsive grid layout, something I had not had time to practice on other projects thus far.

Technologies: Tailwind CSS, Node, GitHub Pages (deployment).

### [A simple Ruby On Rails Pokedex App](https://rubyonrails-pokedex.onrender.com/pokemonsters
)
A simple CRUD-functionality Pokedex App, which was my first project in Ruby on Rails, having worked primarily in React/Next JS thus far! 

Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Render (deployment)

### [A React Application for recording learnings as a developer, following React best-practices (Vercel)](https://developer-lessons-react.vercel.app/)
The application allows adding, viewing, deleting and updating (via favouriting) of learnings I record on my journey to become a great developer. It was fun to create the favourites filter option, and to experiment with a colour theme toggle in the settings. It was a great opportunity to practice setting up my code in a clear, modular way in React, as well as to practice working with local storage.

Technologies: React, Javascript, pure CSS, Vercel (deployment).

### (X) Timed code challenge examples ‚è∞ 
Sometimes I like to set myself smaller challenges to test my learning.
- 30 minute challenge: build a React widget using at least one hook. This ended up cute!
- 60 minute challenge: display a grid of colours, including their hexcodes in html. This did not end up so cute...
- 90 minute challenge: make a front-end Noughts and Cross app. The game logic for this was the toughest part by far!

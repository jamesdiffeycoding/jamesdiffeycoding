Hi, I’m James 👋

A bit about me: 
- I'm a bit of a code addict - and JavaScript is my current drug of choice!
- I have a passion for mental health and the wellbeing of those poorly served by society.
- I love all things visual 👀 and I'm currently honing my React and Next JS skills. 
- I value quick user feedback, Agile-work practices, and selfless leadership. 🌱

As a young developer, I am keen to build the best habits from the start. If you'd be up for a chat to share your experience, please drop me a line on email @jamesdiffey8@gmail.com 📫

# Project examples

### (1) A functionality-first app for homeless shelter staff.
The application helps staff quickly record information about their service users while out in the streets or back in the shelter. Produced as my team's final project in School of Code's 2023 Winter Bootcamp.

Technologies: Next JS, React, Javascript, pure CSS, Render (deployment), Supabase (Authentication/Authorisation), Toast (popups).

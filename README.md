# Recent Projects
### [Awesun: Solar Energy Visualiser (Next)](https://awesun-solar-visualiser.vercel.app/)

This application visualises the solar energy currently being produced in the UK, connecting to a dataset from University of Sheffield. The project was inspired by Winderful, which does the same for wind energy in the UK. Because of CORS fetch errors, server-side rendering in Next JS was used.

### [Live Deployment Dashboard (Python, Flask)](https://jamesdiffeycoding-pythonlivedashboard.vercel.app/)

This application allows me to check all of my deployments statuses (and prevent any from spinning down with activity) by visiting a single site. Python, Flask and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape my sites for their html content, and the site itself displays whether the url request was valid, and whether the html response to the request was as expected.

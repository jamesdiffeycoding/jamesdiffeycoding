Hi there! I'm a London-based software engineer. [My portfolio](https://jamesdiffey.vercel.app/) consists of various JavaScript, TypeScript and Python projects using various libraries and frameworks. I have most often used React, Next JS and Node in applications involving either my own or publically available APIs. 

I have been fortunate to work and study with incredible peers and tutors that have made me a more well-rounded person. I gained a Master's degree in Climate Change from the London School of Economics; trained as a psychotherapist at the Psychosynthesis Trust; and led research projects to help pioneer the field of Climate Change and Mental Health at Imperial College London.

In all my previous roles, I saw the value that well-designed software good bring organisations. Whether it was for automating repititive tasks, designing an accessible and satisfying product for customers, or for scaling up a mental health intervention to thousands of people, I have seen good software help organisation's achieve their goals and improve their operations. Conversely, I've also seen software that was built hurriedly without due care or research fail to achieve their potential. 

After achieving many of my goals I left my research role to complete a Full Stack Development Bootcamp at the School of Code and **I have thoroughly enjoyed building projects ever since**. 

I'd be delighted for you to get in touch if you are looking for conscientious software engineers in your team. Get in touch at diffeyj@outlook.com

### [My Portfolio (React/NextJS)](https://awesun-solar-visualiser.vercel.app/)
My personal site where I collect some of my favourite personal projects. The animated hover-effect over the lilypad design reflects my background and interest in nature. This site sends requests to my other deployments to ensure they are up and running.

### [Awesun: Solar Energy Visualiser (React/NextJS)](https://awesun-solar-visualiser.vercel.app/)
This application visualises the solar energy currently being produced in the UK, connecting to a dataset from University of Sheffield. The project was inspired by Winderful, which does the same for wind energy in the UK. Because of CORS fetch errors, server-side rendering in Next JS was used.

### [Mathemagical (TypeScript/React/NextJS/Jest/Playwright)](https://mathemagical.vercel.app/)
A collection of Mathematical projects, including a fully-tested, keyboard-friendly calculator app which overcomes JavaSCript's typical Mathematical rounding errors using Decimal JS - and 'Spiraliser' for animating beautiful equations using React and HTML's canvas element.

### Timed code challenges ‚è∞ 
Sometimes I like to set myself smaller challenges to test my learning.
- 30 minute challenge: build a React widget using at least one hook.
- 60 minute challenge: display a grid of colours, including their hexcodes in html.
- 120 minute challenge: make a front-end Noughts and Cross app from scratch.
